The Leading-Car/Intersection Model

A simple traffic simulation. Based on the work of Treiber et al. [1], driver behaviour is governed by the car directly in front ("leading car"), and includes capabilities for merging intersections.

This module was developed as part of my research for my undergraduate thesis. A cursory glance at the code will reveal that I did not actually use git as part of the development. Thankfully, I have learned much in the intervening years. In conclusion, here be dragons and good luck.
